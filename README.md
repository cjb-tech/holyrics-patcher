# holyrics-patcher

**EN** | [RU](README-ru.md) | [UK](README-uk.md)

Set of patches for Holyrics.

Currently, the patch only removes the annoying "zero slide" with the title and author. Other useful patches will be added in the future.

## Usage

Download HolyricsLauncher.exe from [Releases](https://github.com/cjb-tech/holyrics-patcher/releases/latest) and copy it to the Holyrics folder (usually C:/Holyrics) next to Holyrics.exe.
From now on, run HolyricsLauncher.exe instead of Holyrics.exe - it will launch Holyrics with all changes.
Don't forget to create a new desktop shortcut and pin it to the taskbar.

> ðŸ’¡ This patch does not change the original Holyrics files, so to run Holyrics without patches - just run the old Holyrics.exe.
